 In this repositry I have demonstrated simple use of nltk vader sentiment analysis and
 few features of vader module of nltk.
 
## Brief Introduction :

 Sentiment analysis means to find if a sentence is positive, negative or neutral.
 There are mainly two types of Sentiment analyzer -
 
 Polarity Based : It says a text is either positive or negative.
 Valence Based  : It provides intensity based sentiment, means words 'nice', 'good'
                  and 'excellent' have different scores. 'good' is more positive than
                  'nice' and 'excellent' is more positive than 'good'. 

 nltk comes with an inbuilt module to analyze sentiment of a text called VADER. 
 It is a lexicons based sentiment analysis module. It has a collection of words with
 how positive or negative a word is. Each word is lexicon have corresponding intensity
 ranging from -4 to +4.
 
 It gives sentiment output as negative, positive or neutral ranging between 0.0 to 1.0.
